# Conclusion

What's missing ?

- Several primitives like tables, waveforms, etc. are missing
- Replace current interval computation
- Proper C++ code generation
- Merge with dev branch
- Future extensions:
  - interleave(P)
  - upsample(N,P)
  - downsample(N,P)
  - modulation
- Code génération improvements:
  - Data Parallelism
